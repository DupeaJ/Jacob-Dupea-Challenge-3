# Jacob-Dupea-PasswordGenerator
## Description
For my Challenge 3, I was tasked with making java functional password generator with a little help from starter code. Making a password generator has really had its challenges from making an array to if statements to make prompts work correctly. The webpage lets you generate a password with a series of questions through prompts. It should be interactive and visually apealing with affects and java script that works.
I learned what it means to make java script from scratch and how to ask questions and get a correct responses to the question answers.
I learned some new features as well, I greatly increased my understanding of java and arrays and how I can use them in an interactive webpage.
